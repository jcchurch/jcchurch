# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James Church.

Hi, Iâ€™m Dr. James Church, an Associate Professor of [Computer Science and Information Technology](http://apsu.edu/csci) at [Austin Peay State University](http://apsu.edu) since 2016. My primary responsibilities in the deprtment are teaching web development and software engineering courses. I am also the director of our [APSU Coding Camps](https://www.apsu.edu/csci/camp/), which teach computer programming to children. I've written and been granted several grants to support these camps. I'm also the program chair of the [ACM Mid-Southeast Conference](https://www.acmmidsoutheast.org/). I'm also the author of the book Learning Haskell Data Analysis, which is several years outdated at this point.

While in grad school, I wrote a [linear algebra library in C](https://github.com/jcchurch/C-Linear-Algebra) based on The Matrix Cookbook. I also wrote an early Amazon Alexa Skill named [Hunt the Yeti](https://github.com/jcchurch/HuntTheYetiAlexa) and published the full source code for others to learn how to make their own Alexa Skills, but much of this is now out of date. In my past work, I wrote radar processing software for a super computer in MPI-C for a defense contractor.

My [Office Hours](https://www.apsu.edu/csci/faculty/office-hours.php) are on the department website.

Courses Taught in the Fall 2023:

- CSCI 4230 Programming Languages (on-ground)
- CSCI 4602 Software Design and Architecture (on-ground)
- CSCI 2700 Data Communications and Networking (on-ground and online)

## ðŸ‘€ My Interests

I'm interested in software engineering, image processing, and computational geometry.

## ðŸŒ± I'm Learning

Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in Rust and develop applications using Flutter. I've never written a mobile application before!
